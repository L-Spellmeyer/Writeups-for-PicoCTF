# Writeups-for-PicoCTF
This repository is dedicated to the documentation of my completion of PicoCTF challenges and to practice formatting requests for generative ai to organize notes provided by me. Each challenge will have it's own folder and each folder will contain three documents. The first being my personal notes, key takeaways, and the solution I found for each challenge. The second file within the folder will be the formatted response of a generative ai when prompted to organize the notes I took in a way to be helpful to anyone looking for a solution to the challenge. The third and final file will be the back and forth conversation with whatever ai I use in each instance that resulted in the output of the formatted solutions file.
