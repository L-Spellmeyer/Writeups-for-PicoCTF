# Writeups-for-PicoCTF
* This repository is part of an ongoing personal project dedicated to practicing my formal documentation skills as with the help of generative ai.
* The documentation in this repository originates from completed PicoCTF challenges. Each challenge will have it's own folder and each folder will contain three documents.
    1. The first being my personal notes, key takeaways, and the solution I found for the specified challenge. 
    2. The second file within the folder will be the formatted response of a generative ai when prompted to organize the notes I took.
    3. The third and final file will contain the prompts and responses of whatever ai I use to format my notes and thoughts.
*  As I complete CTFs I will add entries to the list linking them with their respective writeup folder.
